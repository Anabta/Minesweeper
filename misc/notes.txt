Bugs:
In the settings window: when you select custom but don't fill width/height/bombcount
In the settings window: when not selecting anything but pressing ok nothing happens
When using the double-click method, sometimes you just randomly won

ToDos:
put automatic opening of fields into another thread
double clicking should open all fields nearby
